NOTE:
The credentials in the data directory have been generated by an actual AWS
account, but immediately made inactive. Since they are not active keys,
there are no security concerns with distributing them, or having them in 
your Github account.

Keys in this directory were valid AWS keys so they are accurate representations
of what an actual Access Key ID/Secret Key looks like.
